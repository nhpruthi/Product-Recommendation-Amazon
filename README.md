**Product Recommendation System for e-commerce businesses**
A well developed recommendation system will help businesses improve their shopper's experience on website and result in better customer acquisition and retention.

When a new customer without any previous purchase history visits the e-commerce website for the first time, he/she is recommended the most popular products sold on the company's website. 
Once, he/she makes a purchase, the recommendation system updates and recommends other products based on the purchase history and ratings provided by other users on the website. 
The latter part is done using collaborative filtering techniques.
